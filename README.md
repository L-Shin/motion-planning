Lauren Shin's discrete motion planners!
========================================

code
-----

Two planners, random and optimal, are found in `planner.py`.

There are two sets of `unittest` tests. `test_Planner.py` tests the `search` methods in `planner.py`. `test_Utils.py` tests the non-public utilities in `planner.py`.

There is one file `timing.py` that tests runtime and path length for both search methods in `planner.py`.

input files
-----------
The `input` folder contains a few NumPy array files containing cool discretized world states. `test_maze()` in `test_Planner.py` demonstrates how a planner can be used to navigate in a NumPy array file.

documentation
--------------
Open html documentation by running 
```
$ open docs/_build/html/index.html
```
or manually open the path to index.html in your browser.

You should hire me!
